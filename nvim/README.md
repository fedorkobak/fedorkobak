# `nvim` config

This folder contains my neovim configuration.

This file contains useful links and tips on configuration and usage.

Check:
- The [user docs](https://neovim.io/doc/user/) in the official neovim site.
- The [user manual](https://neovim.io/doc/user/usr_toc/#user-manual).

The **configuration file** is `~/.config/nvim/init.lua`.

**Note** use the `.venv` script to configure nvim to load its configuration from this folder for immediate experimentation.

Some basic configuration options:

- `vim.cmd("set expandtab")`: use spaces instead of tab.
- `vim.opt.clipboard = 'unnamedplus'` to only use the system clipboard and omit the internal vim configuration.
- `vim.opt.shiftwidth = 4`: amount of spaces to move the selected lines with `CTRL+</>`.
- `vim.opt.tabstop = 4`: amount of spaces to insert when the TAB is pressed in edit mode.

## Windows

Nvim can handle multiple documents simultaneously with buffers, windows, and tabs.

See the dedicated [Windows guide](README/windows.md) for buffer commands, split management, resizing, and tab navigation.

## Modes

**Visual** the mode in which you can select some text. It supports following features:

- **Blocked Visual Mode**: activate blocked visual mode with the capital letter `V` and you will be able to select individual columns rather than whole lines.
- **Move inside selected**: if you need to select more on the other side of the selection, there is no need to recreate the visual block. Just move to the end with the `o` letter.

**Visual blocked** is a variation of the visual mode that allows you to select a block of text without having to select each line up to the end. This approach provides some features associated with completing repetative oparations on the different lines:

- Enter insert mode with `I` and text added in the first line would be added in all lines.
- Entering insert mode with `A` works the same but insert new text at the right sight of the selected area. 
- With `c` command the selected block would be removed, and the typed text would be substituted in the each line.

**Terminal**

- To open terminal use `:terminal` command.
- To start typing enter the edit mode, as usualy using `i`.
- To return to normal mode use `<C-\>,<C-n>` by default (Changed to `<C-w><Esc>` in my configuration).
- This configuration uses [`akinsho/toggleterm.nvim`](https://github.com/akinsho/toggleterm.nvim) plugin to manage terminal. Open the toggleterm with ```<C-`>``` command (which is for unknown reason is equivalent to the `<C-Space>`).

**Replacing**

Enter the replacing mode with the capital `R`. All characters you type, replace the characters under the cursor.

## Vim motions

Vim motions are the main navigation system for moving through text efficiently.

See the dedicated [Vim motions guide](README/vim-motions.md) for movement tricks, jumps, and macros.

## Shortcuts

You are supposed to configure the shortcuts for the nvim editor.

Do this with lua function command:

```lua
vim.keymap.set(mode, shortcut, command)
```

Where:

- `mode`: modes where the shortcut would be available (`n`, `e`, `v` etc.). 
- `shortcut`: the shortcut you want to set up.
- `command`: the command the shortcut will execute.

**Special keys** are shortcuts that are usually wrapped in `<>` brackets. The following table shows the denotations for common keys used in key combinations.

| Key          | Notation        |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| Enter        | `<CR>`          |
| Escape       | `<Esc>`         |
| Tab          | `<Tab>`         |
| Backspace    | `<BS>`          |
| Space        | `<Space>`       |
| Leader key   | `<leader>`      |
| Local leader | `<localleader>` |

**Modifier keys** The Ctrl, Alt and Shift keys are considered as modifyer keys, so they can only be used in combination with other keys. They must be refereneced as follows: `<C-{key}>`, `<A-{key}>`, `<S-{key}>`.

| Key          | Notation        |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| Shift        | `<S+{key}>`     |
| Ctrl         | `<C+{key}>`     |
| Alt          | `<A+{key}>`     |


**Note**. In shortcuts you can use the special `<leader>` key, which is the special key for shortcuts configured for this user. By default, the `<leader>` is equivalent to space.

## Registers

Vim contains several clipboards, which are called 'registers'. They have names composed of one symbol. The default register is named `"`, and anything that is yanked, deleted or replaced appeared in this register.

You can select the registry to use by entering a command that begins with the `"` symbol. Then specify the registry you want to use and the specific command you want to apply:

For example:

- `"1y` to yank the text to the register called `1`.
- `"1p` to pase the text from the register called `1`.

This would work with any command related with copying/pasting.

Check the "Using registers" seciton of the [Copy text between files](https://neovim.io/doc/user/usr_07/#07.5) chapter of the vim manual.

The [telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) has a great feature for the registers. View your registers with the `:Telescope registers` command.

## Lua

Lua is used to configure and extend Neovim through the `vim` runtime API.

See the dedicated [Lua guide](README/lua.md) for runtime path notes, running Lua snippets, and the Neovim API table.

## LSP

Neovim supports the lsp features check the [documentaion](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lsp.html).

To restart the LSP use command `:LspRestart`.

Some important commands:
- [`vim.lsp.enable`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lsp.html#vim.lsp.enable()) enables given lsp server. 
- [`vim.lsp.buf.definition`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lsp.html#vim.lsp.buf.definition()) go to the definition of the given object (`gd` in this configuration is mapped for this command).
- [`vim.lsp.buf.type_definition`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lsp.html#vim.lsp.buf.type_definition()) jumps to the definition of the type of the object under cursor (`grt` default shortcut).
- [`vim.lsp.buf.references`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lsp.html#vim.lsp.buf.references()) shows all the mentions of the symbol under cursor in the special window (`grr` default shortcut).
- [`vim.lsp.buf.hover`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lsp.html#vim.lsp.buf.hover()) shows a hover window that contains the information about the symbol under the cursor (`K` to show the hover, `KK` to enter the hover and navigate inside it like in regular window).
- [`vim.diagnostics.open_float`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/diagnostic.html#vim.diagnostic.open_float()) opens the show diagnostics in the floating window. This means that if lsp or formatter marked some problem you can get additional inforamation in the floating window. The `<shit-e>` is mapped to this opperation in configuration.

## Plugins

Plugins are managed with [Lazy](https://lazy.folke.io/) and provide most of the editor extensions used by this configuration.

See the dedicated [Plugins guide](README/plugins.md) for Lazy setup, Telescope, and file browser notes.

## Search and substitute

Vim has built-in search and substitution commands for navigating matches and replacing text by pattern.

See the dedicated [Search and substitute guide](README/search-and-substitute.md) for search syntax, word boundaries, replacement ranges, and substitution flags.

## Debugger

The way to use debugger with neovim is by using [`nvim-dap`](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap) plugin.

This configuration uses:

- `<leader>dc`, `<leader>dn`, `<leader>di`, `<leader>do`: continue, step over, step into and step out respectively.
- `<leader>b` to set the break point.
- `<leader>dr` opens the dap window, where you can type the variables whose values you want to inspect.

A terminal is automatically created for each debugging session. It stores messages from the processe's stdout. Use the `:ls` command to show all available buffers; the buffer created for the DAP will have the `[dap-terminal]` in it's name. Use the command `:b <number>` to open the corresponding buffer.

**Note.** The [`debugpy`](https://github.com/microsoft/debugpy) have to be installerd in the environment to use dap.

## vimscrip configuration

Sometimes it's useful to have the same configuration in vimscrip style rather than lua style. This is useful as some other tools contain facilities to build vim-like workflows and they sometimes the vim scirpt. So here is listed configuration for vim-script that I use:

```vim
set relativenumber
set clipboard=unnamedplus
```
